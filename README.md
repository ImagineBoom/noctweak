NoCTweak: an On-Chip Network Simulator

Authors: Anh Tran (Andrew), and Bevan Baas

A networks-on-chip (NoC) simulator allows designers to early estimate performance (latency and throughput), energy efficiency (average/peak power, average energy per packet) and area of several networks on-chip configurations at different CMOS nodes. This tool is a cycle-accurate simulator and is open-source using SystemC, a C++ plugin, which is used to quickly model complex systems at a higher level but less details than RTL.

NoCTweak has been extended and integrated into McSim, a project developed by Dr. Abdoulaye Gamati√©, Dr. Gilles Sassatelli, Dr. Manuel Selva et al. at LIRMM lab. McSim is a simulator for NoC-based many-core platforms, and is a part of the DreamCloud European project. DreamCloud allows dynamic resource allocation in many-core systems targeting high performance and energy efficient embedded applications.

+ Features
	- benchmarks: synthetic, real/embedded applications, multithread traces
	- topologies: mesh, torus, ring
	- router architectures: wormhole, virtual channel, circuit-switched, shared queues
	- routing algorithms: deterministic, adaptive, table-based
arbitrating policies: round-robin, iSLIP, winner takes all

+ Wormhole router with optional pipeline stages:
	- 1 stage: 
		. type 1:   BF+LRC/SA+ST+LT
	- 2 stages: 
		. type 2_1: BF | LRC/SA+ST+LT
		. type 2_2: BF+LRC/SA | ST+LT
		. type 2_3: BF+LRC/SA+ST | LT
	- 3 stages: 
		. type 3_1: BF | LRC/SA | ST+LT
		. type 3_2: BF | LRC/SA+ST | LT
		. type 3_3: BF+LRC/SA | ST | LT
	- 4 stages: 
		. type 4:   BF | LRC/SA | ST | LT
	- 5 (not necessary)
	
+ Simulation reports:
	- average packet delay and network throughput
	- average power of the router and its components
	- global clock tree + PLL according to the number of routers
	- average energy per packet
